# LinearRegression-Model
#Problem definition:
The problem is the difficulty for the customer to find out the price of a PC he intends to buy according to his requirements and preferences.

#Solution and used algorithm:
In order to enhance the customer experience in discovering the intended PC price, I built a tool prediction that consider 3 attributes which are ram, speed, and HD. The costumer can specify
his reguirements in terms of these attributes to find out the predicted price.
I used linear regression model to apply this solution for the foloowing reasons:
1- The used ttributes are numerical (ram and HD are categorical but can be considered as numerical).
2- Prediction is the main issue.
3- Data discovering phase shows a linear relation between the price attribute and the independant attributes.
